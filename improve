Document Title: Review and Recommendations for Build and Pipeline Processes
1. Pull Request (PR) Builds
Triggering Mechanism:
PR builds are triggered on the Front-End (FE) when a PR is raised, excluding branches such as master, development, and release.

Requirement for PR Builds:
While PR builds are not mandatory for the FE, they are crucial for ensuring code quality. Despite the additional time consumption, having PR builds offers significant benefits.

Example: The benefits derived from one PR build include:

[Provide an example or data point if available]
2. Scanning Intervals and Projects
Current Scanning Intervals:

Project	Scanning Interval	Notes
highwire	5 minutes	Scanning required only on dev
highwire-client	5 minutes	Long indexing time, needs review
xmlvalidator	5 minutes	
ai-assistants	5 minutes	
highwire-var	10 minutes	
infrastructure-ami-bakery	1 minute	
infrastructure-v2	2 minutes	
stats pipelines	3 minutes	
Review Notes:

Projects with less frequent changes could have their scan intervals increased to optimize resources.
Example: highwire-client takes a significant amount of time to index and trigger builds automatically. This needs further investigation.
3. Scanning Necessity
Scans are required to detect:
New branches.
Code changes.
Multibranch pipeline updates.
Recommendation:
Scans are essential for triggering automatic builds on commits without manual intervention. However, the scan intervals should be reviewed and adjusted based on project activity levels.

4. Pipeline Parameters
Recommendations for Back-End (BE) Projects:
Add parameters for the following stages:
Deployment (test, stage, and preprod).
Unit tests should follow the testing and stage deployment processes.
Release stages:
Demo.
Preprod (parameterized).
Beta release environments (introduce an approval stage before deployment to beta).
5. Pipeline Improvements
Stats Pipelines:

Evaluate and improve deployment stages.
Highwire Pipelines:

Add parameters to streamline the deployment process.
Adjust deployment stages to align with branching strategies.
Stats-Client:

Transition to a new deployment system.
6. New Environment: PreProd
Deployment Approach:
Define whether all branches or only release branches should be deployed to PreProd.
7. Automated Build Triggers
Automated triggers are essential for ensuring consistent and timely builds.

Prod Deployment Pipeline:
Consider introducing a separate pipeline for production deployments to enhance process clarity and reduce risks.

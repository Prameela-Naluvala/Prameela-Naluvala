Some of the queries / improvements: 
•	When is the PR Build Trigger? 
PR build is triggered on FE when a PR is raised(not branch master, development, release)
•	Do we need a PR build? No PR is required on FE 
For quality code, PR builds are required. Hope it would consume time but better to have
Example from 1 PR build
 

•	What is the interval for scanning? Which Projects have scan? 
         highwire, highwire-client, xmlvalidator, ai-assistants has 5mins interval
in highwire scan required only on dev
         highwire-var -10mins
         infrastructure-ami-bakery = 1min
         infrastructure-v2 = 2mins
        stats pipelines- 3mins

Note: highwire-client build is taking long time to index and trigger build automatically –To check

•	Do we need them at all ? Lets review each branch / project and finalize 
these scans are required to detect new branches, changes,especially in multibranch pipelines and trigger automatic builds on commits without needing manual inervention.

but we can increase the scan interval on some projects where we don't push the changes often.

•	What parameters can be added to simplify? Lets review all project pipeline 
on BE we can add parameter to deploy stage, test and preprod
unit tests should go after test, stage deployment
release demo, preprod(parameter -- only preprod),   beta release envs (aaproval stage before beta release envs)
•	What are pipeline other projects? Any improvements required there ? 
stats pipelines require some improvements
Highwire pipelines too require improvements - adding parameters, adjusting deployment stages with branches
stats-client – use new deployer

•	We have new environment – PreProd – What about deployment to this ? Branch ? etc 
all branches or release??
•	Do we need automated triggering of builds. Yes
For prod deployment shall we have a separate pipeline??

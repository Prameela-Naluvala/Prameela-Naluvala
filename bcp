For your BCP (Business Continuity Planning) testing, especially since it's your first time and you don't have templates, you might consider the following steps to develop an effective testing plan:

1. Define Objectives:
Scope: Determine what aspects of the Highwire application you want to test—such as data recovery, system functionality, and client access.
Goals: Set clear objectives for what you want to achieve with the BCP test. This might include validating the recovery process, identifying gaps, or ensuring minimal downtime.
2. Develop a Testing Plan:
Test Scenarios: Create realistic scenarios that might affect your application, such as a server failure, data corruption, or network outage.
Roles and Responsibilities: Assign roles for your team members involved in the test, including who will perform recovery tasks and who will monitor the process.
3. Prepare Test Data:
Backup Data: Ensure you have recent backups of your application data and configurations that can be restored during the test.
Test Environment: Set up a test environment that mirrors your production environment as closely as possible.
4. Test Execution:
Simulate Disruptions: Implement the scenarios you’ve developed. For instance, simulate a server failure and observe how your system handles it.
Recovery Procedures: Follow the established recovery procedures to restore functionality and data. Document the time taken and any issues encountered.
5. Monitor and Document:
Track Progress: Keep detailed logs of the test process, including any deviations from the plan and the results of recovery attempts.
Collect Feedback: Get input from team members involved in the test to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
6. Review and Improve:
Analyze Results: Assess the outcomes of the test against your objectives. Identify any weaknesses or gaps in the recovery process.
Update Plans: Revise your BCP based on the findings from the test to improve your recovery strategies and procedures.
7. Communicate with Clients:
Inform Clients: Let your clients know about the BCP testing and any potential impacts on their services.
Provide Updates: Share the results of the testing and any improvements made as a result.
Additional Tips:
Consider Using BCP Tools: There are tools available that can help automate and manage BCP testing processes.
Look for Templates: Even if you don’t have templates, you might find useful BCP templates or guidelines online that can serve as a starting point.
